### CRACKER

#### Short description:
Create a program that will take hash generated by "crypt" function on a Unix/Linux system, and 
via "brute force" approach find a password used to generate given hash string. 

#### Specification:
•	Program accepts one and only one command-line argument: a hashed password.<br/>
•	If program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one 
command-line argument, program prints an error and exits immediately, 
with main returning 1 (thereby signifying an error).<br/>
•	Otherwise, program must proceeds to crack the given password, and printing the password in the clear, with main returning 0.<br/>
•	Password must be hashed with C’s DES-based (not MD5-based) crypt function.<br/>
•	Each password is limited to five (5) characters.<br/>
•	Each password must be composed entirely of alphabetical characters (uppercase and/or 
lowercase).<br/>

#### Example behavior:
$ ./cracker<br/>
Usage: ./cracker hash

$ ./cracker 50cI2vYkF0YU2<br/>
LOL

#### Warning:
Cracking hash generated with five character password, may take up to 30 minutes, for testing purposes usage of 3 or 4 character long passwords is recommended.<br/>

#### Extras:
For password hash generation, additional utility named "hashit.c" is included. Execute the program, then input your password and "salt" when prompted.
